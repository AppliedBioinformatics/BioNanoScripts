# BioNanoScripts
Scripts used for BioNano analysis.

* I will gradually upload some useful scripts for BioNano analysis. 
* All scripts can be run on linux platforms. For windows platform, we don't recommend, as some of them will raise 'cPickle.PicklingError'.

Any comments please raise in [Issues](https://github.com/AppliedBioinformatics/BioNanoScripts/issues)
